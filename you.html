Every day that I'm not with you seems like an eternity. I long for the next time we'll be together again. So that we can hold hands…….honestly its one of the best parts of my day……..I know I come up with a lot of excuses (and I am sorry for that) which might look like as if I don’t want to meet you but trust me it’s not so…..I only do it to protect us ……so we can last forever……lastly I love you so much……..
